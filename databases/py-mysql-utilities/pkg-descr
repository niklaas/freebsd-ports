MySQL Utilities is both a set of command-line utilities as well as a Python
library for making the common tasks easy to accomplish. The library is written
entirely in Python, meaning that it is not necessary to have any other tools or
libraries installed to make it work. It is currently designed to work with
Python v2.6 or later and there is no support (yet) for Python v3.1.

The utilities included are: mysqldbcompare, mysqldbcopy, mysqldbexport,
mysqldbimport, mysqldiff, mysqldiskusage, mysqlfailover, mysqlfrm,
mysqlindexcheck, mysqlmetagrep, mysqlprocgrep, mysqlreplicate, mysqlrpladmin,
mysqlrplcheck, mysqlrplshow, mysqlrplsync, mysqlserverclone, mysqlserverinfo,
mysqluc, and mysqluserclone.
